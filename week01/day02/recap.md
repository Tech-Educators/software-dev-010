Learned how to create files and open things in vscode.

pwd - (print working directory) tells you where your are. `users/sam/projects`
ls - list - lists all the things inside the current directory. 
mkdir newfoldername - makes a new folder (directory)
cd .. - goes back a step 
cd - goes back to the root
cd foldername - moves you into a folder/directory.
touch index.html - create file
code . - opens vscode in the current directory.
